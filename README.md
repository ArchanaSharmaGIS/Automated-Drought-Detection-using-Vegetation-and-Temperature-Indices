# Automated-Drought-Detection-using-Vegetation-and-Temperature-Indices
This project utilizes remote sensing data and Google Earth Engine to analyze crop drought conditions by calculating Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI). These indices are valuable for understanding the impact of drought on agriculture, allowing for proactive intervention in drought-prone regions.
